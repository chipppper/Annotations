#About Diana

-When HSUS FAP was going through a real hard time, Josh desperately scrambled for new ways to bond the team and prevent more people from quitting. He started going to DCH for advice (as Dave's friend, I got to hear he found this turn of events rather unsettling as Josh used to be his mentor, almost a father-figure, and he found it odd/upsetting/a bad sign that Josh would come to plead for advice about how to manage a team)

-Anyway, as a result, we started to roll out "About Me" videos like the ones that THL staffers were doing at the time...except we had no real guidance on desired formatting and since I stepped up to go first, I took the liberty to make my kind of artsy/impersonal (i.e. you don't hear me talk about myself at all)

-But you do get to learn about some of my favorite things, brought to you by the letter 'S'! :^)
